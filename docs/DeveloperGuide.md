## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Blacklist feature
The blacklist mechanism is facilitated by `Person`.
It represents if a `Person` is blacklisted or not, stored internally by adding a `Blacklist` object to the parameters of `Person`.
Blacklist status is displayed externally via `PersonListCard#blacklist`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person.
A new `Person` is created, with the default status of un-blacklisted.
It is then added to `AddressBook`.

![BlacklistState1](images/BlacklistState1.png)

Step 2. The user decides to blacklist the person, and executes the `blist INDEX` command.
The `blist INDEX` command will create a new `Person` with the same information as the person at `INDEX` in `AddressBook`,
but with a new `Blacklist` with a different blacklist status, which then replaces the original person.

![BlacklistState1](images/BlacklistState2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the blacklist operation works:

![BlacklistSequenceDiagram](images/BlacklistSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a blacklist command:

![BlacklistActivityDiagram](images/BlacklistActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: The command format of blacklist

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `blist INDEX` to toggle blacklist status.
    * Pros: Easier to remember, faster to type.
            More straightforward and logical for a value with only 2 states.
    * Cons: Requires checking current blacklist status.

* **Alternative 2:** `+blist INDEX` to blacklist, `-blist INDEX` to un-blacklist.
    * Pros: Able to directly set blacklist status without checking current status.
    * Cons: More commands to remember.
### Sort feature
The sort feature is implemented in the `SortCommand` class.
Below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `sort c/...` to sort the contact list according to some specific criteria.
The `UI` component passes the string to the `LogicManager` class in the `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates a corresponding `SortCommand` object.

Step 3: The `LogicManager` executes the `SortCommand` object. This calls the appropriate `sort` method in
the `Model` component.

Step 4: The `Model` component sorts the internal contact list. After sorting, the appropriate method in the `Storage`
component is called to update the file.

Step 5: Finally, the `Model` component passes the `CommandResult` back to the `Logic` component, which in turn passes
it back to the `UI` component to display it to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the sort operation works:
![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find persons by tag and address feature
This feature is built on the current `find` command, which is used to be limited to only finding persons by names. With this change, the format of the `find` command is now modified to `find n/[NAME] t/[TAG] a/[ADDRESS]`.
This command returns the persons with attributes that matches at least one of the attributes of interest (See User Guide for more details).
Note that users are only required to provide at least one of the parameters to use this command. In other words, commands such as `find n/Alex` and `find t/autistic` are valid commands.

To facilitate the implementation of this feature, three new predicate classes are introduced, namely `PersonTagContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `ReturnTruePredicate`. The former class is to check whether any of the `tag`s contain the keywords. The latter predicate always returns `true`. 

The introduction of `ReturnTruePredicate` may seem pointless, but it is of great use. The key here is to realize that if X is a boolean variable, then X `and` `true` simplifies to X. If all keywords are given, the `FindCommand` class will receive `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PersonTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`. If, say, only `name` keywords are given, then two `ReturnTruePredicate`s will be supplied to `FindCommand` instead.
As such, the filter will now solely depend on `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` since the second predicate always returns true.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` command works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when `find` command is executed.
![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

##### Aspect: Command design

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `find` command alone supports finding by names and tags.
    * Pros: More intuitive to use since most commands have similar format. Makes further extensions easier as developers only need to define a new predicate class.
    * Cons: Can make debugging harder since further extensions are centralized into one class.

* **Alternative 2:** Find by names and find by tags are separate commands.
    * Pros: Easier to debug as one command is meant for one criterion.
    * Cons: It is now not possible to combine both criteria together. More commands to remember. Due to similarity of the commands, they can be confused from one another.

### Mode of Contact feature
The mode of contact feature built on the current `AddCommand` class.
The following is an example usage scenario.

Step 1: The user executes `add n/Bob …/m email …` to add a new Person with the mode of contact as `email`.
The `UI` component then passes the string to the `LogicManager` class in `Logic` component.

Step 2: The `Logic` component parses the string and creates an `AddCommand` object.

Step 3: The `LogicManager` class then executes the `AddCommand` object, which calls all the appropriate methods including `mode of contact` in the `Model` component.

Step 4: The `Model` component adds the inputted string and the appropriate method in the `Storage` component is executed to update the file.

Step 5: The `Model` component passes the `CommandResult` to the `Logic` component, which is then passed to the `UI` component to display to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:
![ModeOfContactSequenceDiagram](images/ModeOfContactSequenceDiagram.png)

    
### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `State`. It contains an undo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStates`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `State#addState()` — Saves the current contact list state in its history.
* `State#deleteState()` — Deletes the current contact list state. The undo operation is done by calling this method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `State` will be initialized with the initial contact list state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the contact list. After execution, `State#addState()` is called, causing the modified state of the contact list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStates`.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified contact list state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution or does not modify the contact list in anyway, it will not call `State#addState()`, so the contact list state will not be saved into the `addressBookStates`.
Examples of commands that do not modify the list include <code>find</code>, <code>list</code> etc.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If there is only one state saved in the <code>addressBookStates</code>, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#getPreviousState` to check if this is the case. If so, the method will return <code>null</code>
, causing the command to return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases …​ }_

### Deleting a contact

1. Deleting a contact while all contacts are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

    1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
